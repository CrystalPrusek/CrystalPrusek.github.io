So the question is, “why did you decide to study Software Engineering?”.  The 1st thought that pops into my head after reading that question is; “wow you’re actually doing it!”. Six months ago if someone would have told me that I was going to start studying Software Engineering I wouldn’t have believed them. Needless to say though I’m beyond stoked! Originally I went to college for Acting. I had a great time and learned a lot but, postgrad I was finding it a little hard to apply my degree to a steady career. Especially now being that there is basically no theatre or filming going on anywhere. I’ve been taking this time in quarantine to ask myself some big life questions. A question that was constantly popping up for me was, “what do you want your career path to be?”. I have loved doing theatre but I couldn’t help thinking that i’d like to do something a little more substantial as my “job job”. I know I love creating and building things and have always wanted to learn how to code but just didn’t think I was smart enough.  Got to thinking that coding felt like an extension of my interest in building just with a new medium. So basically, I did my research and followed through (which doesn’t happen all that often for me) and here I am! I’m really excited to be learning a new skill during these times too where I often have a whole lot a nothing to do. I feel like with this new career path I might be able to make a bigger impact on the world. Maybe leave a little legacy?
